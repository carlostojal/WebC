# WebC

Simple web server made in C using sockets.
I made this project to learn more about HTTP by doing it myself from scratch.
This project uses HTTP/1.1.

The `src/main.c` file is basically a demo of the library usage.

## Disclaimer

This is not stable or secure. I highly don't recommend using this in production environments (as if someone was going to do it).
